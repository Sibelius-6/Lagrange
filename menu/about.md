This website includes some LaTeX tricks I used to do fancy stuff. They might be incomplete, or redundant, but it just works well :) Basically LaTeXers don't care much about whether the code is elegant or not... So for most tikzpicture drawings, I would strongly recommend [mathcha](https://www.mathcha.io/editor).

Also, if interested, check my [home page](https://sibeliusp.com), [blogs](https://blogs.sibeliusp.com) and [lecture notes](https://notes.sibeliusp.com).
